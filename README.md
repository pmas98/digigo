"""
A command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with a Digimon API.

This script provides a Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL) interface for querying a Digimon API and displaying the results in the terminal. The user can enter commands to search for Digimon by name, type, or other attributes, and the script will make HTTP requests to the API and parse the JSON responses.
